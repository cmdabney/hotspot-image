        <h1> Plants are the New Bacon.</h1>

        <P class="main-text">
            There’s no exact name for it; meat, that’s not meat. You could call it “fake meat”, but vegan chefs hate that, saying there’s nothing fake about it, it’s real food. Alternative or plant-based proteins are more accurate terms. And they have made themselves
            a home in New York, L.A, Chicago and other American cities. The popularity of vegan meat has been steadily rising in restaurants, supermarkets and home kitchens. According to a recent Euromonitor report, the United States had the largest packaged
            vegan food market in 2015, with a value of roughly 1.29 billion U.S. dollars.

        <P class="main-text">
            One of the reasons for the rise in popularity is a simple concept: vegan products are not just for vegans. Young Americans are becoming increasingly more health conscious. Strict vegans (1.7 percent) and vegetarians (3.3 percent) still make up just a
            small percentage of the country’s population, but more and more people are starting to make food choices based on health and environmental concerns. People are adopting a more plant based diet, even those who do not consider themselves vegan.
            The demand for more healthy, clean and environmental-friendly food has made the steady sales growth of vegan products possible.

            Champs – an all vegan diner in East Williamsburg Brooklyn – opened its doors in 2010. Since then, they have been a popular spot for vegans and non vegans alike. Matt Sellitti, a Brooklyn resident and non-vegan, comes to Champs often for the Chicago style
            hot dog,</p>
        <br>
        <p class="main-text">“I just kind of think of vegan food as it’s own cuisine, like Italian or Chinese. I often choose vegan ‘meat’ over animal meat. I like the taste and I like that it’s healthier. You don’t have to be totally vegan to want to make healthier choices,”
            says Sellitti.

            The production of plant-based food is far more environmentally friendly than animal agriculture. However, vegan meat is produced at its own costs. Outi Kuittinen, an author of a cookbook for food with low carbon footprint and a visiting practitioner at
            Harvard University warns against replacing one meat production with another. She advocates for eating little processed food, letting vegetables be vegetables and cutting off meat almost completely: </p>

        <br>

        <p class="main-text"> “The environmental impact of food is a very complex issue, but we can't be having complex discussions with ourselves every time we're having dinner. The safest rule of thumb is to go for food coming from plants and cooked by you or someone else,"
            says Kuittinen.
